# Multiomics_Integration
Multiomics Integration with Denoising Autoencoder and Neural Network Classification
This project integrates multiomics data using a denoising autoencoder (DAE) and neural network classification to predict disease phenotypes. It combines genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data from the BRCA, ROSMAP, and TCGA datasets.

Datasets:
BRCA: Breast cancer data (gene expression, mutations)
ROSMAP: Alzheimer's and neurological data
TCGA: Cancer data across multiple types
Methodology:
Data Integration: Combine different omics layers for a comprehensive analysis.
Denoising Autoencoder: Reduce noise and extract important features.
Neural Network Classification: Predict disease subtypes or patient outcomes.
Features:
Multiomics data preprocessing and normalization
Denoising using autoencoders
Neural network-based classification
